# WHAT I LEARNED:

- node requires you to restart the server after every change, while nodemon watches it continuously withou tyou having to update it. 
- .catch is like try catch without the try. It just catches the error and runs whatever you tell it to. In the  case of this video, it just logs the error in the console. 
- can also use npm run in the terminal when trying to run a server that you may have installed during the npm init process.
- Use router.get instead of app.get when you're using the router file vs using the server file.
- .sort { date } sorts the items by date; -1 for descending and 1 for ascending. 
- Get returns information, Post creates a new collection to be added. Put updates. Delete deletes.
- Use double quotes for keys and values in json.
- findById (thanks to mongoose) finds the item by ID.
- .then runs an order of events after a function is ran.
